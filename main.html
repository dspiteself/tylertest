<p>The goal of BreezeEHR is to give the provider an experience that is more like a conversation with medically trained personal assistant than filling out an IRS form. We find that most providers who are familiar with template based medical record systems want more than input boxes to fill in. BreezeEHR uses a general rule engine to give medical professionals a more flexible, intelligent and real-time experience.</p>
<h3>Flexible</h3>
<p>Providers often feel trapped, unable to express the precise concept he or she wants to express. We allow the providers to decide what trade-offs to make between the power of rich searchable structured data and the convenience and speed of traditional paper. In any context in the encounter the provider can add his own free text description of a concept. This automatically starts a workflow for this concept or alias to be added to the terminology. If you must fall back on paper we introduced the following methods:</p>
<h3>scanning</h3>
<p>we developed a one-click solution to scan and attach a documents. Documents can be attached directly in context like a lab printout to an order(or even the the billing code) or a wellness questionnaire to the encounter it was taken.</p>
<h3>writing on the screen</h3>
<p>You can put your existing paper forms directly into the system to be filled out on the screen. You can then suggest the form based on a condition of any data entered on the encounter.</p>
<h3>Intelligence</h3>
<p>Our system relies on the intelligence of modern descriptive logic and semantic databases like UMLS and Snomed CT to understand the entered medical information and to provide simple tools for the provider to define live interactions on the medical encounter. The system's goal is to allow medical experts to have complete control to define and modify the providers experience. The rule engine defines three kinds of live interactions. They are triggered by the evaluation of logical combinations of conditions based on any data collected for the patient. Rules are built on an organizational structure. They can be shared, composed, inherited and overridden by organizations or individual doctors.</p>
<p>The 3 types of rule based interactions:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information and Alerts</span></p>
<p>This type of interaction can alert or inform the doctor with inline text and links. An example would be to alert the doctor of a woman's pregnancy status on the administration of certain drugs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestions</span></p>
<p>A suggestion interaction allows the provider to build a rule that adds a concept to a pick list on the side of the encounter. It was designed to keep the provider from having to manually search for concepts. For example a symptom such as sore throat could put streptococcal soar throat in the suggestion list in the assessment section.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defaults</span></p>
<p>With this interaction a provider can define a medical statement to be made(including defaulting any value) based on any condition. The provider must sign off on any such statement. This interaction can save the provider a lot of time. It allows doctors to document things that would otherwise been tedious. For example a procedure could be defaulted to "point of care" or "send out" for a specific practice. This interaction is also used to fill out a default pharmacy ready prescription from a dosage category and a drug formulation.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Implementing human based rules is a time consuming process and is different from specialty to specialty. We built in simple machine learning to suggest interaction conditions by discovering patterns in the relative likelihood of groups of concepts appearing on the same encounter. The more encounter a provider generate the more closely these predictions will be tailored to him.</p>
<h3>Real-time</h3>
<p>With breezeEHR A provider will not have to waste as much time refreshing pages. Not only will the rules update after every keystroke and after every selection made but the changes will instantly appear for everyone who has the encounter open. Our imaginations have only begun to engage the possibilities opened by this feature. Some of the simplest uses are nurses entering vitals as the provider is gathering the history of present illness or the doctor could get the point of care test results before he or she even leaves the patients room. A more interesting example would be a dynamically updating priority in an ER encounter as the information was entered.</p>
<h3>Other features</h3>
<p>BreezeEHR is web-based this means you can access the EHR from anywhere you have internet access. As a provider you can sign and review charts and lab results from home</p>
<p>BreezeEHR was designed with Scalability in mind. The rule engine was designed in such a way that it could be run in parallel across several machines. The potential number of rules that can be evaluated is nearly limitless</p>
